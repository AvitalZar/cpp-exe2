system programing exercize 2
</h1>

exercize on operator overloading on matrix, without using the standard library.

the project includes tests of doctest for every operator (in test.cpp), and a main for run example.

run with a makefile (and not a makeFile. stupid mistake you should not get involved in for two hours),
where:

`make main`

`make test`

`make valgrind`

`make clean`

each one run the obvious matching.

*may the force be with you or something.*
